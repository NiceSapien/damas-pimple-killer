      <h1>Just wash off your damas face, bro.</h1>
      <p>
        You know very well that the best fix is wash off your face, and you're
        still here. Poor you. Don't go away yet(till ya wanna keep looking
        damas)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a proper face wash for pimples</li>
        <p>
          Preferably, the one with neem. Normal soaps and stuff can increase
          pimples
        </p>
        <li>Wash the damas twice a day with face wash</li>
        <p>
          You have to wash your damas face twice a day with a face wash.<br />Wash
          is 3 times without it, too.
        </p>
        <li>Popping them</li>
        <p>
          C'mon, are you kidding me, its so satisfying! I can't stop it! Just
          stop it, damas.
        </p>
        <li>Stop eating damb things</li>
        <p>
          Hmm, burger, tasty! Damas you, stop with the junk food. All the damas
          you eat comes on your face. Eat some fruits and vegetables.
        </p>
        <li>Exercise</li>
        <p>
          By doing exercise, your self respect goes up &#128200; and you become
          cooler. Your sweat helps alot in better, brighter skin.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why do these damas pimples even exist?</h2>
      <p>
        You were too cool and they were jealous. Just kidding. Even a shoe
        wouldn't be jealous of you, because atleast it doesn't have pimples.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Puberty</li>
        <p>
          Pimples are one of the most damas things you see during puberty(both
          in males and females&#128532;). This is due to increased amount of
          acne. Now im no dermotologist, that i dont even know its spellings,
          you may want to watch this video.

        <p>
          dam, i mentioned the same thing again? Vro, i have to make this page
          longer so need useless damas to put up in it. Acne can worsen if you
          stress too much btw, do some meditation.
